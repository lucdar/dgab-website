            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                Dance Games at Berkeley exists to foster a community around and through arcade style dance games like Dance Dance Revolution, Pump It Up, and In the Groove. 
                The club also manages and maintains the Dance Dance Revolution machine in MLK Student Union. 
                The club and machine are open to all people of all skill levels and experience.
            </p>
            <p>The Machine is open whenever the UC Berkeley MLK Jr. Student Union is open. Their operating hours are available <a href="https://studentunion.berkeley.edu/contact-us/">here</a>.</p>

                        <li>Be Gentle with the pads. They are modified to be extra-sensitive so aggressive stomping isn't necessary.</li>
                        <li>Keep your items off of the machine when not playing.</li>
                        <li>Do not place open-lid drinks or food on or near the machine.</li>
                        <li>Do not go behind or open the back of the cabinet.</li>

                <li>Respect the space
                    <ul>
                        <li>Follow the direction and rules put in place by MLK staff. The cabinet is in their building and all of their rules still apply.</li>
                        <li>Clean up after yourself.</li>
                        <li>Keep noise levels to a reasonable level. Excessive noise can be disruptive to players and other people who we share the space with.</li>
                        <li>Stay a few feet away from the machine when you are not playing.</li>
                    </ul>

                <li>Respect each other

                        <li><b>Our community has zero-tolerance for bigotry or hate of any kind.</b> If you ever feel unwelcome, let MLK staff any officer know and we'll address it accordingly.</li>
                        <li>Be kind, helpful, and welcoming to veterans and newcomers alike.</li>
                        <li>Use and respect the queue. It can get long, but it's only fair if everyone waits their turn.</li>
                        <li>Do not manipulate or game the queue in a way that is unfair to others.</li>
                        <li>Do not play songs longer than 10 minutes without the consent of everyone else in the queue.</li>
                        <li>If the queue is long (4+ rows), play with someone else if possible.</li>
                        <li>If you're confused, ask questions! Our Discord server is open to everyone, and our community is more than happy to answer any questions you may have.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Use common sense and understand that this list of rules is not exhaustive for actions that aren't welcome in our community.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Consequences for rule violations depend on the severity of misconduct. They can range from a verbal/written warning to a report to the center for student conduct.</p>
