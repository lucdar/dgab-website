            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                Dance Games at Berkeley exists to foster a community around and through arcade style dance games like Dance Dance Revolution, Pump It Up, and In the Groove. 
                The club also manages and maintains the Dance Dance Revolution machine in MLK Student Union. 
                The club and machine are open to all people of all skill levels and experience.
            </p>
            <p>The Machine is open whenever the UC Berkeley MLK Jr. Student Union is open. Their operating hours are available <a href="https://studentunion.berkeley.edu/contact-us/">here</a>.</p>
