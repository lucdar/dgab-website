        How has the DDR Machine / Dance Games at Berkeley impacted you?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        When I first found the DDR machine in lower MLK in 2022, I was happy to
        see that there was support for the game in Berkeley. I enjoyed playing
        and reliving some memories as I used to play in elementary school. I
        made some friends and got to be a part of a community that is open to
        many who share their love for the game. I was sad to hear when Berkeley
        decided to remove the machine from MLK, as it was an accessible location
        for members and the public to approach and try the game out. When the
        machine was brought back to Eshleman 312, I was happy to see support for
        machine as there became a dedicated area for the machine, while being
        next to open space for accessibility to others. I have been able to meet
        and make new friends, as well as share my love for the game through a
        shared space.

        The removal of the DDR Machine makes it harder to meet others regarding
        DDR. While we have been able to communicate online through our previous
        connections, the abrupt removal of the machine brought a sudden slow
        down in communication within the community. Since then, I have not been
        able to meet others regarding DDR in a common space on campus.

        It's a perfect communal space to connect with newcomers to the game.
        When I was college aged, dance gaming helped me in so many ways it's
        unimaginable to think about life without it! It helped me make friends,
        stay in shape, fall in love with music, learn how to compete
        respectfully, and more. The Cal spot reminded me of what I sort of wish
        I could have built for myself back in the day.

        Well, as someone on the outside, it seems as if the space was taken away
        for quite asinine reasons. There's a problem if the DDR community was
        misbehaving and not listening to the needs of the greater Cal community.
        They abided by everything asked of them and seemed to have the rug swept
        out from under them literally overnight. This just seems… wrong. I can't
        think of another word for it. Unjust, maybe? I feel for the community
        since it was that utopian space I experienced (in my prior paragraph
        above) and then overnight it was just removed. That's painful. It's
        unfair. And it's just… stupid. Why not just share feedback with DDR club
        admins and allow them to rectify any and all issues with the existing
        setup? Very childish.

      <p class="answer">
        The DDR Machine is how I met most of my current friends. It's the most
        effective community-builder I've seen in my four years on campus. You
        could do your homework in between sets, socialize with the people around
        the machine, and on top of all that the machine was free to play. I
        would regularly visit the machine in between classes, and I could
        reliably expect to see the same faces there every time I went. Out of a
        shared passion for the game, we grew closer and built friendships that
        I'm sure will last for years to come. <br />
        In addition, playing DDR has several benefits. It's a healthy way to
        stay active, and getting better at the game teaches you habits and
        lessons that aren't just exclusive to the game--they can help you with
        school as well. Getting better at the game has shown me that I can
        become pretty good at something as long as I put in deliberate
        practice."

        To be frank, it was devastating. I was left without a community space.
        This is my last semester at Berkeley, and I was expecting to graduate
        and leave Berkeley on a good note, with a robust community to come back
        to at any time. But the machine's sudden removal tarnished that, and
        left a bad taste in my mouth.

        Prior to the introduction of the DDR machine at UC Berkeley, I had zero
        experience with playing DDR. The DDR community here UC Berkeley was very
        welcoming, and I had a gentle introduction to the machine. With the help
        of the more active members, I learned how to operate the machine. After
        going a few times, I even got pretty good! I had so much fun that back
        when the machine was still in the student union, I would make that spot
        the weekly meeting spot for me and my friends to do homework. They ended
        up enjoying playing the game a lot too, and I was able to build a
        community there for myself.

        It is truly heartbreaking. The DDR machine and the DDR community at
        Berkeley was a wonderful escape from the day-to-day struggles of class.

        When it was publicly available I had a lot of fun taking people to the
        machine and playing with friends. I was a casual enjoyer but it was such
        a special and fun game that always was popular. The new games in mlk
        can't compare to the good energy that DDR brings to a space and to my
        day when I stop by to play it.

        I never got to play it because it was taken out so quickly. Eventually I
        went there with a friend I had told about it and was increasingly
        disappointed to find out it wasn't there. I just want to be able to play
        DDR and have a good time with my friends.

        I met so many friendly and welcoming people that made me feel accepted
        into the community. They taught me how to navigate the ITG system on the
        DDR machine and I've been obsessed ever since. <br />
        When the DDR machine was still at MLK, I went almost daily. I changed my
        sleeping schedule so I could come in the mornings to play before my
        class at 9am on Fridays. After my ballroom practices on Mondays and
        Tuesdays, I would walk by MLK and I would queue up to play a game of
        DDR. <br />
        The reason why I came so often was not only because I enjoyed the game,
        it was also because everyone who was part of the community was welcoming
        and friendly. Greg would come and bring Yi Fang to everyone. Rita would
        make funny maps and skins and share it with the community. And all of
        the officers would interact with new members, and we'd all recognize
        each other's faces. It's amazing.

        It has affected me greatly. <br />
        When I received the notification that the DDR machine was going to be
        removed AGAIN because of the student union, I was devasted. I just came
        out of the hospital, and I was hoping to go back to the DDR machine the
        next week to destress - only to realize that I could never play it again
        for the rest of the school year. It's just terrible. <br />
        Being at the DDR machine was a way for me to meet new people and
        socialize with others while getting a cardio workout. It was destressing
        and fun. My mental health has been the worst yet in my 4 years at
        Berkeley and now I lost one of the main ways I destress on this campus.

        I am a kinesiology student at SFSU. Back in high school and even a bit
        now, I was an extremely shy person. Going to a college by myself without
        my one best friend was extremely horrifying for me. I've played at the
        DDR machine back when it was still in MLK but it wasnt until i was in
        college that i started interacting withthe DG@B community. They've been
        such a great help for my phyche and has been one of the friendliest and
        welcoming communities i've been in. If it wasn't for the kindness of the
        officers and fellow club members, I would have stayed a loner in SFSU.
        The DDR machine provided a great outlet for socializing and finding new
        people while encourging healthy habits and exercising. DDR helps build
        cardio, legs and even upper body at higher levels. After discovering
        DG@B I've lost weight and gotten more in shape which has helped me feel
        more confident and more comfortable in my own body. The space created in
        MLK as well as ESH was a nice space to study or hang out to destress.
        Kinesiology is really taxing and being able to just dance away really
        helped with getting me through the semesters. The CS majors could
        probably say the same.

        When it was announced that DDR was returning through ESH, it was like a
        ray of hope had finally shown down. Both my mental and physical health
        were declining and it was hard to find a reason to return to UCB.
        Currently as I am sitting in ECH, i only regularly see 2 of my friends
        from DG@B. I used to look forward to going to UCB, but now ECH has
        become just another study spot. But above being sad, I am extremely
        livid towards the decisons made towards DG@B. We were kicked out because
        we were unwelcoming and territorial???? I was at ECH almost every day of
        the week. And from what I have witnessed and done, we have done none of
        that. I understand if some of the better players could be intimidating
        but does that have to do with us not welcoming people. Its like saying
        CS students in berkeley are too smart, lets not hire them. Also the fact
        that all of the "complaints" were hidden from the officers was
        disgusting. In part 4c of the the MoU that both ASUC and DG@B agreed to,
        ASUC is responsible for "contacting DG@B in a timely manner should any
        concerns arise about the DDR machine". If any of the complaints were
        delivered, the club collectivly would have tried to resolve the issue,
        but none of it was brougt to light until we were kicked out. The
        eviction also gave 2 days to move the machine. Furthermore, a grand
        opening was held the day after we moved out? It was like ESH stabbed us
        in the back.

        I stumbled upon the DDR machine in MLK during GBO, and I was super
        excited to see this game here since I've never been to an arcade but
        recently really wanted to play. Looking back, I don't know if I would
        have had such a great group of friends if not for the DDR machine. I'm a
        shy person, and during my first semester at Cal, I really just studied
        next to the DDR machine and played my set. But everyone was really
        friendly and they helped me get better at the game too, so it brought me
        out of my shell a lot. It was a space to play DDR, but it was also a
        study space where we could go between classes, where we would see
        familiar faces, eat together, and just hang out. The community here is
        great, and it's a way different atmosphere than an arcade, where people
        tend to just play their set. People teach one another how to pass
        difficult songs, help make custom charts for the game, and some of us
        also learned how to modify the sensitivity of the arrow panels. Somehow,
        getting passionate about DDR also helped me learn more about a lot of
        different things, like music, engineering (building my own pad!), and
        software. Not only that, but the DDR machine was completely free, and
        run by students. Normally at an arcade, it costs $1-2 to play 3 songs,
        and most of the time, the machine is not maintained well because there
        isn't always someone there who knows how to improve the playing
        experience. I think bringing a whole DDR machine to Cal is amazing, and
        a serious amount of work, and it makes it even more meaningful that it
        was done by a small but passionate group of students that has been
        growing ever since. I can honestly say that the DDR machine completely
        changed my experience at Cal for the better.

        I feel devastated that I need to write one of these testimonies again,
        first for the removal of the machine for MLK, and second, for the
        removal from Eshleman 312 that happened recently. I lost an important
        community space with 48 hours notice. As an officer, I was unavailable
        to help move the machine within that time frame as it was midterm
        season, and it was very lucky that we found people available to move it
        in time. We were not notified in a timely manner about any complaints
        about the DDR machine, and it's affected me a bunch, since I've tried
        really hard to make the space comfortable and inviting (and from what I
        saw, it was a good fit for the space, and people were interested in
        playing!). Our club has spent a whole year sending emails, talking to
        people, trying to find a new place for the DDR machine, and finally we
        found 312, only to get removed abruptly after ~1 month due to
        communication issues. I don't really see my friends from DG@B on week
        days because we don't have this space to go anymore, so I really only
        see them on the weekends if they can make the trip to go to Hayward
        Round1 or if we collectively organize a meetup. Now Eshleman 312 is just
        another study space.

        DGAB has been by far the most invested I have ever been in a club, and I
        don't even go to berkeley for school. What it has basically done for me
        was "oh look a DDRmachine" to "oh this is my life now". Before I started
        going to DGAB meetups I was a very shy person and was uncomfortable
        going out of my way to talk to anyone. Now this club and community has
        turned into kind of like a second family for me. The people I've met
        were all really kind and supportive of any new faces regardless of skill
        level with the club itself having a diverse range of beginner,
        intermediate and advanced players. The best part about being in DGAB was
        witnessing your peers and yourself improve at the same time. Two years
        ago we were all tripping over our own feet and didn't know what a
        footswitch is. Now we're consistently improving our form and timing
        precision. I am very grateful for DGAB because it has opened up a can of
        worms for me I really enjoy. Ever since moving out of state, DDR has
        become my main and only workout. In an arcade I frequent, I wouldn't be
        as close of friends with some of the people I now know if it wasn't for
        the groundwork that DGAB has paved for me. From learning which arrow pad
        to press to being able to mentor intermediate players and participating
        in local tournaments, the experiences and interactions I had in DGAB
        were priceless.

        The removal of the DDR machine was a very big blow to take in. For the
        past 2-3 years I solely commuted to Berkeley just to play DDR. DGAB
        offered an outsider like me a safe space to learn and have fun with
        other peers. It has also made organizing meetups difficult because back
        then we would gather around the DDR machine with a few new faces every
        time. Now with the machine gone, our main option is to just grab a bite
        together. There are many familiar faces I have not seen in a long time
        that I wish to hang out with again.
